  Hi, my name is Domitille and I'm a PhD student working on the genetic basis of plant specialized metabolites variation in two model species sessile oak and bread wheat. 
  
  I'm looking for a postdoc position :)    
  
  In my project:    
    1) I study the genetic basis of leaf specialized metabolites variation within sessile oak populations using genome-wide association approaches with genomic and metabolomic data.   
    2) I study specialized metabolites gene expression response induced by the infection of *Fusarium graminearum* in modern bread wheat cultivars using transcriptomic data. I also study the potential role of gene expression variation between homoeolog genes copies in differentiated gene expression response among cultivars to the infection.  

  **Keywords**: population genomics, genome-wide association analysis, evolution bioinformatics    
  **Programming Skills**: R, Python, Unix, Snakemake, Singularity, Slurm-HPCs, Git

  #         I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
